# Instructions

The WordNet dictionary can be accessed either through the command palette or the WordNet button on the ribbon.

Once invoked, WordNet will allow you to input the word you want to look up. As you type, options are shown. Once you find the word that interests you, you can press enter to have it inserted into the current document. If the current document is in preview mode, the definition will be displayed in a notification window for about 10 seconds.
